### Summary

In this repository we provide some simple examples for apache flink with scala.

If you want to execute the stream processing examples, you have to open a terminal and then do

```bash
nc -l 9005
```

`nc` stands for "netcat", which is a networking utility

`-l` stands for "listen mode"

`9005` is the port on which the utility will listen for incoming connections

(I chose the port `9005` because of reasons.)

Have fun!
